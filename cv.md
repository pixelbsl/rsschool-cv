### About myself:

I have long wanted to learn a remote profession, and your training is what I need.

I recently started learning programming languages like HTML and CSS on my own. I want to become a frontend. I like this specialty and see in it a huge prospect and further development in this area.

I believe that I can become an excellent specialist!

***

### Learning:

* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript
* Git, GitHub
* VsCode

***

### Code example:

*Create a function that finds the integral of the expression passed.*

In order to find the integral all you need to do is add one to the exponent (the second argument), and divide the coefficient (the first argument) by that new number.

For example for 3x^2, the integral would be 1x^3: we added 1 to the exponent, and divided the coefficient by that new number).

_Notes:_

* The output should be a string.

* The coefficient and exponent is always a positive integer.

```

 3, 2  -->  "1x^3"
12, 5  -->  "2x^6"
20, 1  -->  "10x^2"
40, 3  -->  "10x^4"
90, 2  -->  "30x^3"

```
